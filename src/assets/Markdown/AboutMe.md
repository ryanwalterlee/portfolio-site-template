### Introduction

Hello Viewer, My name is Ryan Walter Lee, currently a Year 2 Computer Science student at the National University of Singapore.

### Other Interests (besides SWE of course)

I enjoy doing calisthenics, in fact, I'm currently the Captain of NUS Calisthenics, a CCA where we help all students to achieve their better self.

I'm also a huge marvel and Naruto fan and my youtube suggestions can vouch for that.

### Career goals

My long term goal is to be a software engineer. I like software engineering because of the amount of challenge it brings. The process of building a website or app is very tough, but the satisfaction of making something work or successfully debugging triumphs all.

As such, I am looking for software engineering internships during my summer (May - end July, full time) and winter (Dec full time, Jan part time) breaks.
